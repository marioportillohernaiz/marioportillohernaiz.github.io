	This meant I had to make sure the swimmers did the work during their session and sometimes lead it when the coach was dealing 
	with something else. Whenever a swimmer had doubt about a race or a session, I was also responsible of either giving them 
	advice, or asking the coach for advice which I would then deliver it on.<p>
